<b>Changes:</b><br><h3>Low angle and low angle</h3>
<br>Shot in which the camera is bellow or above the subject, thereby imposing some form of judgment that is transmitted to the audience.
<br><h3>Dutch angle</h3>
<br>Shot in which the camera is tilted to one side, creating a sense of instability.
<br><h3>Point of view</h3>
<br>Often shortened to ‘POV’, shows what a character is seeing at a certain point.
<br><h3>Voyeur and dark voyeur</h3>
<br>Aesthetically similar to the POV, but doesn’t have to be the point of view of a character in the film. It creates a sense of looking in on the characters in the shot, as if intruding.
<br><h3>Mask</h3>
<br>Shot that has an overlay (most often black), to show that the audience is seeing the scene through a specific medium (like a keyhole).

<b>Changes:</b><br><h3>Panoramic</h3>
<br>Movement that only consists of a rotation of the camera.
<br><h3>Traveling</h3>
<br>Movement that only consists of a translation of the camera.
<br><h3>Pano-Traveling</h3>
<br>Movement that only consists of both a translation and rotation of the camera.
<br><h3>Vertigo</h3>
<br>Camera technique where the movement of the camera is compensated by the changing of the focal length, creating a distortion of the perspective.
<br><h3>Crane or Lima</h3>
<br>Movement where the camera is placed to a crane, often creating an arc like motion.
<br><h3>Handheld camera</h3>
<br>Way to hold or move the camera in a shaky and unsteady way. It creates the sensation of grittiness because of its similarity to documentaries.
<br><h3>Steadicam</h3>
<br>Similar to the handheld camera but steadier (obviously), creating a sense of reality because it is much closer to the human experience.<br>
